<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I am a Haematopathologist by profession and love the inner workings of the human body. 
  There is so much that I have learnt about the human body and there is still so much to learn.
</p>

<p>
  My job entails a lot of pattern recognition, searching for the abnormal patterns within the normal
  patterns.  In my search for finding more efficient ways to perform my set of skills, I have become more
  and more interested in the prospect of using artificial intelligence in recognising the abnormal
  patterns in haematology.
</p>

<p>
  I firmly believe that this kind of technology would be hugely beneficial in accurately detecting the 
  abnormal patterns within the normal ones.  Even more accurately diagnosis the pathology that might be present.
</p>

<p>
  Not only am I interested in using this type of technology but actually encoding this kind of technology 
  in an effort to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of my set of skills.  I have very limited technological
  skills and that is not surprising, given my medical profession.  But I am excited with the prospect of learning
  new skills to enhance the current skills that I have.
